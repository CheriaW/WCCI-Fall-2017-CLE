# Git
### Git Commits
- Each time there's a code change, we make a commit.
- We can think of a straight line with many dots, each dot representing a commit.

### Benefits of Git
- Allows us to collaborate/work with others.
- `master` is the default branch for any git repository when it is created.
- We have the ability to create other branches.

### Creating Branches
- `testBranch1` or `featureBranch` as demonstrated in class.
- Called branches because they look like branches on a tree. Difference is that they merge back in to master.
- Branches create a copy and allow us to have a separate place to work on something.
- Separate stream of development, separate commits, exist on their own.

### Might want to create a branch ...
- To test something that you're not sure you want to have as a part of your program.
- To work on a specific feature separate from the rest of the project before integrating it back in.
